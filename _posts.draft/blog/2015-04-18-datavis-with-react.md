This is a transcript of the presentation I gave at the OpenVis conference
 ([Slides](http://ilya.boyandin.me/openvis-react)Â | [Video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=dcLrbiHIX5M)).


## Interactivity
Data visualization is all about communication.
We want to reach out to other people and communicate our findings about some data.
Or we want to help the data, so to say, to speak for themselves.
The medium we use for this communication plays an important role
in the way we can present information to the audience.

Today visualization developers can take advantage of the interactive displays.
Interactivity is important because it enables data exploration.
We only show one facet of the data at a time without overwhelming the user with too much information,
but allowing them to look at other facets.
