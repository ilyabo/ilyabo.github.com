This was a project I volunteered to help with. 
I built a simple video annotation tool used for a medical study
carried out at [Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin](https://nephrologie-intensivmedizin.charite.de/).

The full title: [“Point-of-care lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients: inter- and intra-observer agreement in a prospective observational study”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90153-2).
The results of the study were published in [Nature - Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90153-2).

The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ilyabo/covid19-charite-lus).
