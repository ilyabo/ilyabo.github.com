Until recently making [flow maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_map) has involved manual drawing or knowledge of programming
 or specialized software. I had learned from my experience developing
 [flow](https://github.com/ilyabo/jflowmap)
 [mapping](https://github.com/ilyabo/jflowmap.js)
 [libraries](https://github.com/teralytics/flowmap.gl)
 that there was a need for a tool with which people without special knowledge could make flow maps and
 share them online. This is why I developed [flowmap.blue](https://flowmap.blue).
 Itâ€™s a web application for publishing interactive flow maps from data uploaded to Google Sheets.
 It's free, it requires no installation and allows anyone to create a flow map in no time.
