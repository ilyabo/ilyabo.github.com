Here's the abstract of the talk:

> Understanding human mobility patterns is important in fields like migration studies,
> urban and transportation planning, epidemiology, and disaster response. Data on
> human mobility are often voluminous and difficult to interpret in tabular form; therefore, visualisation plays an important role in their analysis. One of the most widely
> used visualisations of such data are flow maps that represent movement between
> geographical locations as lines of varying thicknesses. Flow maps usually do not accurately depict the exact movement routes. Instead they are aimed at answering questions such as: Where are the origins and the destinations of the flows on the map?
> What are the magnitudes of the flows? Where are the largest flows? Or more complex
> ones like: What is the spatial structure of the flows network?
>
> Until recently, making flow maps has involved manual drawing, or knowledge of programming or specialised software. I had learned from my experience developing flow
> mapping libraries that there was a need for a tool with which people without special
> knowledge could make flow maps and share them online. This is why I decided to
> develop Flowmap.blue. It is a web application for publishing interactive flow maps
> from data uploaded to online spreadsheets. It is free; it requires no installation and
> allows anyone to create a flow map in no time. Since the tool was released, people
> from different parts of the world have started using it to visualise various human mobility datasets and are sharing them with the general public.
> In the talk I will demonstrate the tool, show example datasets and discuss a few interesting patterns that can be discovered in them. I will speak about the challenges of
> visualisation of human mobility flows and about overcoming them. I will touch on the
> analysis of changes over time, on representing flows with attributes, and on the scalability of the general approach to very large datasets.
