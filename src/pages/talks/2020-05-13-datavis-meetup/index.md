The talk ”Flow Maps” was presented online at 
the [Data Visualization Zurich](https://www.meetup.com/datavis-zurich/events/270384574/) meetup.

What are flow maps? Where do they come from and what are they used for? How can they help understanding mobility patterns or migration? What specific challenges do they represent and what are the alternatives? How do they scale to very large datasets?
