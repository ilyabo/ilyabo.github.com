Hello and welcome!

      
Just a few words about myself. 

I am a software engineer specializing in data visualization. 
I've worked in IT companies, research institutions, 
a <a href="http://interactivethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renowned web design studio</a> 
and currently in a 
<a href="https://www.teralytics.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup in Zurich</a>.
My special interest is in visualizing data about 
geographic movement of people or goods, e.g. transport-related data.
I wrote <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my thesis</a> about this topic.

Check out <a href="/resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my full resume</a> for more 
details on my background and experience.

I am a fan of React, D3, Mapbox and Clojure.

I am the father of two wonderful kids. 

I like to play guitar and piano and
