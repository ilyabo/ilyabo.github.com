I am a full-stack JavaScript developer focused on data visualization. 
I have over a decade industry experience in developing web and desktop applications
representing data from various domains
and research experience in data visualization and machine learning. 
I've worked in IT companies including Sun Microsystems, research institutions, 
a <a href="http://interactivethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renowned web design studio</a> 
and currently in a 
<a href="https://www.teralytics.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup in Zurich</a>. 

Check out <a href="/resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my full resume</a> for more 
details on my background and experience.

My special interest is in visualizing data about 
geographic movement of people or goods, e.g. transport-related data.
I wrote <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my thesis</a> about this topic.

I am a fan of D3, React, Mapbox and Clojure.

I also like to play guitar and piano and
