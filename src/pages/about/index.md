Hello and welcome!

My name is Ilya Boyandin. I am a software engineer specializing in data visualization.

My special interest is in visualizing data about 
geographic movement of people or goods, e.g. transport-related data.
I wrote <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my thesis</a> about this topic.
 
I've completed <a href="/">many data visualization projects</a> for media, private companies, NGOs, transportation authorities 
and research institutions. 

I've worked in IT companies, universities, 
a <a href="http://interactivethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renowned design studio</a> 
and currently in a <a href="https://www.teralytics.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startup in Zurich</a>.

I am a fan of React, D3, Mapbox and Clojure.

I am the father of two wonderful kids. 
I like to play guitar and piano and 
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ibananti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce electronic music</a>.

Check out <a href="/resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my full resume</a> for more 
details on my background and experience.
