My name is Ilya Boyandin. I design and develop geographic data visualizations.
I've completed <a href="/">many projects</a> for media, private companies, NGOs, transportation authorities 
and academic institutions. 
I've worked at big IT companies and startups, universities 
and a <a href="http://interactivethings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renowned design studio</a>. 
Currently, I am helping to build the 
<a href="http://studio.unfolded.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next generation geospatial analytics platform</a>
at <a href="https://unfolded.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unfolded</a>. 
In late 2020 I founded <a href="https://www.geovisually.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoVisually GmbH</a>,
an interactive maps and geographic data visualization consultancy.

My special interest is in visualizing data about 
geographic movement of people or goods, e.g. transport-related data.
I wrote <a href="/assets/thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my thesis</a> about this topic 
and developed <a href="https://flowmap.blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flowmap.blue</a>, a
free online tool for visualizing origin-destination movement. 
I share [much of my code online](https://github.com/ilyabo). 

I am the father of two wonderful kids. My wife is a <a href="http://tanja-boyandin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional translator</a>. I like to play guitar and piano and 
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ibananti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce electronic music</a>.

details on my professional background.
