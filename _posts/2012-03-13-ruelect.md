The presidential election in 2012 in Russia was clearly fradulent.
Despite manipulating the results the authorities published very detailed data on the elections
which made it possible to analyse it and find traces of fraud.

In this visualization the blue dots show polling stations which reported unlikely high votes for Putin:

The interactive version can be found [here](http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/russian-presidential-elections-2012-map-orange/sheet1?:embed=y) (it is quite slow in loading).



## Vote for Putin vs Turnout

Each dot is a polling station, x-axis is the turnout, y-axis is vote for Putin, here you can see “the grid pattern”, that is, the higher concentration of reported turnout and vote for Putin around 75, 80, 85, 90, 95%. This is a clear evidence of fraud.
