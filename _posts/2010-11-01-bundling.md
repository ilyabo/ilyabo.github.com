Edge bundling can help making a cluttered graph visualization more readable by rerouting the edges so that they form bundles emphasizing the high-level graph structure.

The [FDEB bundling algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220506264_Force-Directed_Edge_Bundling_for_Graph_Visualization) implementation is [a part](https://code.google.com/p/jflowmap/source/browse/trunk/JFlowMap/src/jflowmap/bundling/ForceDirectedEdgeBundler.java) of [JFlowMap](https://code.google.com/p/jflowmap/).
