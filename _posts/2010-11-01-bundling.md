Edge bundling can help making a cluttered graph visualization more readable by rerouting the edges so that they form bundles emphasizing the high-level graph structure.
[JFlowMap](https://code.google.com/p/jflowmap/) has an impementation of Danny Holten's [force-directed bundling algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220506264_Force-Directed_Edge_Bundling_for_Graph_Visualization).
